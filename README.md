# Our dream: 
To raise awareness and remove the **devil horns** that have been placed on the Marxist idea. We want to allow as many people as possible to **educate** themselves and **get involved** with the movement. We also want to allow users to donate to causes related to the movement such as **strike funds** or independent newspapers (you can suggest organisations to donate to by opening an issue).

# Roadmap

Finish "Full text" -> Add "Facts" & "Communism & Marxism today" feautures -> Add "Fact of the day" feature  -> Donations and ads implementation -> Beta release on google play -> Google play release -> App store release ?
